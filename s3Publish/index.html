Such questions are often posed as problems to be studied or resolved. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras. Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument, and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? Philosophers also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust? Do humans have free will?</p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy</a></div><br><div><h3>Dog</h3><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Collage_of_Nine_Dogs.jpg/320px-Collage_of_Nine_Dogs.jpg" style=width:320px;height:281px;margin-right:15px; alt="Dog">The domestic dog is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct. The dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.</p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog</a></div><br></body>
